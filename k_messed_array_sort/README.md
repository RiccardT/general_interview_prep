# K Messed Array Sort

Given an array of integers arr where each element is at 
most k places away from its sorted position, code an efficient 
function sortKMessedArray that sorts arr. For instance, for an 
input array of size 10 and k = 2, an element belonging to index 6 
in the sorted array will be located at either index 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 
in the input array.
