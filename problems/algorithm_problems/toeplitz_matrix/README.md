# Toeplitz Matrix

A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where every 
left-to-right-descending diagonal has the same element. 
Given a non-empty matrix arr, write a function that returns 
true if and only if it is a Toeplitz matrix. The matrix can 
be any dimensions, not necessarily square.

Example 1

    [[1,2,3,4],
    [5,1,2,3],
    [6,5,1,2]]

    True

Example 2

    [[1,2,3,4],
    [5,1,9,3],
    [6,5,1,2]]

    False
