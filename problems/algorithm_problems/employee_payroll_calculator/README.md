# Employee Payroll Calculator

You are asked to create a modeling of an HR payroll system for your company. 
However, there are different types of employees depending on how their payroll 
is calculated. Implement this using Inheritance, Composition, and other OOP concepts.

Additionally, you are asked to build a productivity system for the company that tracks
productivity across employee roles. Implement this with the above concepts in mind.


### Solution Structure
There are two solutions to this problem;

- An inheritance solution that relies solely on Python's Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance
features to accomplish its goal (This lead to the Class Explosion Problem)
  
- A composition solution that relies on dependency injection/composition to accomplish its
goal. This avoids the Class Explosion Problem and is much more loosely coupled.
