# Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree 
along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path needs to be from parent 
to child (cannot be the reverse).

### Example
Input: root = [1, null, 3, 2, 4, null, null, null, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
